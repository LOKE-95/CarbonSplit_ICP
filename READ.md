## 🚀 About CarbonSplit

CarbonSplit is an eco-conscious, tech-forward initiative that empowers individuals and organizations to neutralize their carbon footprint in a transparent and rewarding way. For every verified contribution towards reforestation or sustainability, the **carbon credit is split**:  
- **50% to you** (the contributor)  
- **50% to the planet** — reinvested in future green actions.

> 🌳 Our motto: *"Every split credit grows twice – once in data, once in nature."*

## 🌍 Why CarbonSplit?

Traditional carbon offset systems often lack transparency and traceability. With **CarbonSplit**, we ensure:
- ✅ Verified and geotagged tree plantations
- 🔐 Immutable tracking of every tree’s growth and lifecycle
- 🔄 Transparent reinvestment into global sustainability projects
- 🧾 Personalized dashboards for contributors

---

## 🔐 Zero Duplication. Full Accountability.

Each tree planted is uniquely tagged and monitored using a combination of:
- **Satellite imaging**
- **NFT-backed digital twin**
- **Growth chain tracking** (verified across seasons)

This means:
- 🌱 **No duplication is possible.** Trees and their carbon impact are uniquely verifiable.
- 📈 You can **track every stage**: from planting, to growth, to maturity — all in real time.
- 🌳 Each tree has a **"Growth Ledger"** — publicly auditable and cryptographically secured.
